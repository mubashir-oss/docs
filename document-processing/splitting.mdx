description: "Split PDF documents by classifying pages into different categories"

## Overview

The Document Splitting feature analyzes PDF pages, classifies them into predefined categories, and creates separate PDF files for each category. This is ideal for processing mixed document batches like scanned files containing invoices, contracts, and reports.

<Note>
The splitting process returns a ZIP file containing the split documents, with classification and confidence score data provided in response headers.

## How It Works

Our document splitting system uses advanced AI to:

1. **Analyze Each Page**: Extract text and visual features from every page
2. **Classify Content**: Categorize pages based on document type and content
3. **Generate Confidence Scores**: Provide accuracy metrics for each classification
4. **Create Separate Files**: Split the original PDF into category-specific documents
5. **Package Results**: Deliver all split documents in a convenient ZIP file

## Supported Categories

You can split documents into various categories:

- **Business Documents**: Invoices, receipts, purchase orders, contracts
- **Financial Documents**: Bank statements, financial reports, tax forms  
- **Legal Documents**: Contracts, agreements, legal notices, compliance forms
- **Healthcare Documents**: Medical records, insurance forms, lab reports
- **HR Documents**: Resumes, employment forms, payroll documents
- **Academic Documents**: Research papers, reports, transcripts

## API Usage

### Basic Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://prod.visionapi.unsiloed.ai/splitter/split-pdf-v1?classes=invoice,contract,report" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -H "api-key: your-api-key" \
  -F "file=@mixed_documents.pdf" \
  --output split_documents.zip
```

### With Category Descriptions

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://prod.visionapi.unsiloed.ai/splitter/split-pdf-v1"

# Define categories with descriptions for better accuracy
categories = {
    "invoice": "Business invoices with itemized charges and payment terms",
    "contract": "Legal agreements, terms of service, and binding documents", 
    "report": "Analytical reports, summaries, and data presentations"
}

files = {"file": ("mixed_documents.pdf", open("mixed_documents.pdf", "rb"), "application/pdf")}
params = {"classes": "invoice,contract,report"}
data = {"categories": json.dumps(categories)}
headers = {"api-key": "your-api-key"}

response = requests.post(url, files=files, params=params, data=data, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    with open("split_documents.zip", "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    
    # Get classification results
    classifications = json.loads(response.headers.get("X-Classifications", "{}"))
    confidence_scores = json.loads(response.headers.get("X-Confidence-Scores", "{}"))
    
    print("Split completed successfully!")
    for page, category in classifications.items():
        confidence = confidence_scores.get(page, 0)
        print(f"Page {page}: {category} (confidence: {confidence:.2f})")

files["file"][1].close()
```
