## Overview

The Classify Document endpoint analyzes PDF documents and assigns them to predefined categories based on their content, structure, and visual characteristics. This endpoint uses job-based processing where files are uploaded to cloud storage and processed asynchronously.

<Note>
The endpoint supports both single-page and multi-page classification with detailed confidence scoring for each page. Files are uploaded to Supabase storage and processed in the background.
