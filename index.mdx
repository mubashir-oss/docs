# Welcome to Unsiloed AI

AI teams spend 6+ months building document workflows, yet fewer than 10% ever reach production. Generic LLM parsers and OCR collapse on multimodal documents with text, tables, images, and charts. Poor parsing and suboptimal chunking cripple RAG pipelines and downstream automation.

Unsiloed AI has built state-of-the-art vision models that serve as the infrastructure layer for turning unstructured data into structured, queryable, and LLM-ready assets. Our APIs are already parsing hundreds of thousands of documents for startups and NASDAQ-listed enterprises, powering vertical AI solutions across industries.

On public benchmarks, Unsiloed AI consistently outperforms solutions from LlamaIndex, Gemini, Mistral, and Unstructured.io.
